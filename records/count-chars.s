# PURPOSE: Count the characters until a null byte is reached.
#
# INPUT:
#       The address of the character string
#
# OUTPUT:
#       Returns the count in %eax

# PROCESS:
#       Registers used:
#           %ecx - character count
#           %al  - current character
#           %edx - current character address
